README for Mail::Field::Received

                           Mail::Field::Received
                           =====================

Mail::Field::Received is a parser of `Received' headers in e-mails.
It mostly complies with RFC822, but deviates to accomodate a number of
broken MTAs which are in common use.

Uses
----

Any program which requires detailed information about the journey an
e-mail took in order to arrive at its present location should find
this parser very handy.

See <http://adamspiers.org/> for an e-mail filter which uses this
module as part of its spam detection heuristics.
